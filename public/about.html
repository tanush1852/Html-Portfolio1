<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Tanush Salian, currently a second year student pursuing Computer Engineering from S.P.I.T, Mumbai.</p>

<p>I am more inclined towards web developing and data analysis. Havent started with any of my personal projects yet but soon will be
  confident enought to start one. I am trying my best to be good at what I am interested in so always reminding myself to explore that
  path regularly so that I won't loose touch.
</p>

<p>Apart from this I love playing games but I personally feel I am more interested in Valorant than the other games. I love watching 
  movies and web series and to have good conversation over that topic. I am also more interested towards personal fitness so I try to
  manage my schedule accordingly so that I can devote some of my time towards fitness.
